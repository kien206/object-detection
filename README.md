2023.1 Introduction to Deep Learning Capstone Project

This repository contains the process of training for each model in the project.
Each folder has 2 files: the first one is the model which we train from scracth with our dataset, the second one is the model with pretrained weights.

You can find our trained weights for each model here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Zt5VBdgbmD3NDtrys33jsGzeOkBKb1tZ
